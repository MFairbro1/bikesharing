# bikesharing

## Overview:

### We are interested in starting a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. Therefore, we need to present Citi Bike data from NYC to investors using Tableau in order to convince them that this is a worthwhile endeavour. 

## Results:

### Here we can see checkout times for all users revealing that most rides are very short, usually around 5 minutes.

### We can see from this graph that males are the primary users by a large margin.

### From the above heatmap we can see that peak riding hours are around 7-9 AM and 5-7 PM during weekdays. Weekend peak hours are around 9 AM to 7 PM.

### The above heatmap shows that males are the primary users during peak hours.

### From the above information we can see that males are the primary subscribers.

### From this graph we can see that the least busy time is from 2-5 AM.

### From the above maps we can see that the most popular starting and ending locations for bike journeys are mostly relegated to lower and midtown Manhattan. 

## Summary:

### From the above visualizations it is clear that the primary user base is male and that most bike trips are short. Peak riding hours are predictably during morning and evening rush hour times when people are travelling to and from work. Males are the primary users during these peak hours and they are also the primary subscribers. Judging by the "August Peak Hours" graph, the best time to perform maintenance is between 1-5 AM. We can also see from the start and end locations on the map that lower and midtown Manhatten are the two primary start and end locations so any bike-sharing venture would benefit from being largely concentrated in the busiest parts of a city. This allows people to circumvent traffic and provides easy access to tourist attractions. Some additional visuals which would provide further insight would be maps showing specifically subscriber starting and ending locations, and basic customer start and end locations.
